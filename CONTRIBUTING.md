If you are interested in submit a contribution written in Python or HTML, we highly suggest you to follow the Django [[竊余](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/) guidelines. For Python contributions, we also suggest the PEP-8 [[竊余](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines, as a second source of information.

####  :heavy_check_mark: Javascript:
All codes written in JavaScript must follow the JavaScript Standard Style [[竊余](https://standardjs.com/).

####  :heavy_check_mark: Commit Messages:
When writing a commit message, always use the present tense and the imperative mood (e.g., "Create model for github projects", "Update index stylesheet", "Create test case for explore section"). If you fix an issue, do not forget to mention it in first line of the commit.
