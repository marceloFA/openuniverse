Developers are often interested in joining the open source universe based on a set of motivations. Our mission is to provide the connection between open source projects who desire new contributors and interested developers who want to contribute.

## Submitting Projects
We are still under development. In a few weeks we will turn available the submission section.

## Contributing
If you are interested in contributing somehow with the open universe project, you can start by reading the development instructions in our wiki section [[竊余](https://github.com/openuniverseorg/openuniverse/wiki). If you have any questions, feel free to message us on Discord [[竊余](https://discordapp.com/invite/wvwRDDj).
